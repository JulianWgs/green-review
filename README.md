# Sustainability Database

Check out the [dashboard](https://sustainability-database.herokuapp.com/).

I couldn't find a website comparing the progress of companies reaching their sustainability goals. That's why I made one. The code for the dashboard can be found [here](https://github.com/JulianWgs/sustainability-database-dashboard).

The data is gathered from sustainability reports of the companies. All links to the resources can be found in `resources.csv`. The extracted data is contained in the `data.csv`. A list of companies can be found in `companies.csv`.

Currently the repository is not under any license which means you can't use the contents without my permission. I plan on changing that. If you want to use the data or have experience choosing the right license for such repository, get in touch.

Your (favorite) company is missing? Create a pull request and add it. After I settle on a data structure I might migrate to Dolt, to streamline the process.
