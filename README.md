# Green.Review

Check out the [website](https://julianwgs.github.io/sustainability-goals-review/).

I couldn't find a website comparing the progress of companies reaching their sustainability goals. That's why I made one. All data needed to create the plots is also available in the repository. The code to create the plots is not yet published.

The data is gathered from sustainability reports of the companies. All links to the resources can be found in `resources.csv`. The extracted data is contained in the `data.csv`. A list of companies can be found in `companies.csv`.

Currently the repository is not under any license which means you can't use the contents without my permission. I plan on changing that. If you want to use the data or have experience choosing the right license for such repository, get in touch.

Your (favorite) company is missing? Create a pull request and add it. After I settle on a data structure I might migrate to Dolt, to streamline the process.
